# Telephone Operator

[The life of a telephone operator in 1969 - AT&T Archives](https://youtube.com/watch?v=zX8RHeSuZZc&feature=shared) - go trough the comments

> In 1980 I was one of the first male operators for the New York Telephone company. At the time it was one of the most demanding and stressful jobs in the company. **They monitored every move you made**. I eventually moved on to becoming a technician. Looking back being an operator taught me to be disciplined and able to handle anything. I stayed for 30 years.

> I did the same if they were jerks.  There was a jack at the top of the cord board for testing.  I think it was called a MW1 jack. It had a loud screeching noise of you plugged in.  I would plug all the jerks into the jack, after checking to make sure no one was observing.  Great times as an operator!!
