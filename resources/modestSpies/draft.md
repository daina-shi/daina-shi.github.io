### Scene 1 - Opening

"Operator, May I help you?"

The voice on the other side was of a middle aged man, maybe in his 40s. Curt, impatient. The words were of a professional, the temparament was not. "Who is this?"

*Who do you think, genius?*

"This is the Madras Exchange, May I help you?" If there was frustration in my mind, it didn't show in my voice.

"I wanna call, area code 40, 210X XXX"

"Thank you!", Why was I thanking him? I was the one helping. Was it *Thank you for talking to your loved ones!* or *Thank you for being a corporate slave and making money for your owner!*? Most of the callers were the same, middle aged men in a hurry, making calls from or to offices. Most were often well endowed, such was the costs involved. Then, who might he have been? 

"Now, Operator. This is a very private call, you're not gonna be listening are you?"

*Why, what are you trying to hide, Mister? Is it a business secret? You're making a work call at 9 in the evening? Get a life, seriously. Or is it romance? Do I smell an affair? Are you calling your lover to inform your visit?*

"I wont be even on the line sir"

"So you're gonna get off the line, as soon as I get the party, right?"

*Oh my god! get over yourself man. Nobody's itching here to know your secrets.*

"Yes sir, Nobody is going to be listening."

I extend a cord and insert the plug into one of the number of jacks in the panel infront of me.

"Okay"

After a small pause, A woman answered the phone. "Hello?" She was expecting the call. She was young, but not that young. Maybe in her 30's. The man replied almost immediately, like he was holding it in.

"Hello, Darli-"

That was enough for me to come to a conclusion. I had nothing against love birds, nor was I so curious to listen to lovey dovey conversations. It was a game. A game to distract me from the routine. A day full of hearing numbers and pulling cords would have surely put me in an asylum. Instead I sneaked into conversations. Nothing major, just a few words. I would guess the lives of the callers. I made people, homes, lives in my mind to pass the time.

Most of these conversations were not even that intresting. Certainly not intresting enough for me to get caught and lose my job. I kept my low profile, just skirted the borders of what's right and wrong. And it was enough to keep me sane. 

Another light here, another beep there. There was another call.

"Operator, May I help you?"

"Hello, who is this?"

*Again? Seriously?*

"This is the operator, Who do you wanna call?"

"Maya?"

My heart skipped a beat. I paused for an instant. That was my name. I was just caught off guard. They were just trying to call some other person named Maya, surely.

"Do you have the number, sir?"

"Maya? You are Maya, aren't you?"

My mind was reeling. I was searching for everything that happened around me recently that could justify the call. It was a prank, surely, it had to be. May be one of my friends put someone up to this.

If I was any sane person who would listen to reason and pay mind to her own safety, I would have hung up. Unfortunately, I wasn't like that.

"How do you know my name?"

"Listen, Maya, While you go home tonight, on your usual route, turn left into the street behind the Radioshack. Walk for a while and you will come to a small cafe, tucked in between a book store and a huge mall. There will be a handsome young man in a white shirt, waiting for you."

"You do-"

*You don't really expect me to show up, do you?* was what I was going to say, before he hung up. 

I spent the next 2 hours in a daze. *Who was that person? How did he know who I was?* Or even better, *How did he know I would be answering?* My mind was full of questions, I had no answers to. There was only one question I could answer, was I going to go to that café like he asked?

### Scene 2 - Meeting at the café

I was walking down the road, in my usual route, after my shift ended at 11 o'clock. A few feet infront of me was the Radio-shack. These few steps ahead of me were a deadline for me to make my decision. It was a choice between assured safety and uncertainity, home and the café, the routine and an adventure. I turned left.
